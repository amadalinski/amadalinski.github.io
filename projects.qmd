In Spring of 2025, I took Quantitative Reasoning at CSU. I learned how to code in R, how to look at and manipulate data, specifically environmental data, in R and got an introduction to data science.

In this assignment I learned-

-   How build and edit my own Quarto website

-   How to upload my website and all its code to a GitHub repository

-   How to navigate my way around the R console and terminal and use its basic functions
