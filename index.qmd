I am a motivated student at CSU, studying Ecosystem Science and Sustainability and Spanish. I have coursework experience in ecology, sustainability science, and watersheds. Outside of my classes, I am a part of the CSU triathlon team, I work for the Boys and Girls Club, and I enjoy hiking, cooking, and reading.
