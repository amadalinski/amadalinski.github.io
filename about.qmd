I am an organized, motivated student. I am able to balance school while having a part job and while being part of a D1 club sport. Through this I have learned to prioritize and be flexible, doing whatever needs to get done. I have a passion for environmental science and protecting our natural spaces and am eager to get a headstart into this career field.
